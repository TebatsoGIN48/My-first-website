            <p>Welcome to Tebatso’s Kota, the heart and soul of Kota culture in Pretoria Hammanskraal. Here, we don’t just make kotas; we craft authentic, filling, and downright legendary township meals with a twist of local pride and flavor. Rooted in the vibrant streets of Hammanskraal, Tebatso’s Kota was born from a passion for bringing people together over food and celebrating the spirit of South African street cuisine.</p>

            <p>Founded by Tebatso, a Hammanskraal native, our kota joint started as a humble idea: to give back to the community while offering an unforgettable food experience. Growing up, Tebatso was captivated by the warmth, vibrance, and stories shared over a simple kota from local street vendors. That’s why every kota here isn’t just food—it’s a tribute to the flavors, creativity, and heritage of our people.

With a love for both traditional recipes and unique twists, we’ve built a menu that keeps customers coming back for more. Our kotas are crafted to satisfy the biggest appetites and celebrate the rich ingredients and culinary legacy of South Africa.</p>

            <p>Our menu is inspired by classic township flavors with something for everyone:

                Spicy Kota: This one packs a punch with a flavorful mix of Russian sausage, crispy bacon, creamy cheese, tangy atchar, fresh cucumber, slap chips, and a perfectly cooked egg. It’s for those who like to turn up the heat!
                
                Medium Kota: A balanced blend of Russian sausage, bacon, cheese, cucumber, and chips, minus the atchar for a more mild bite. The perfect choice for those who want a great balance of flavors.
                
                Mild Kota: Simple, satisfying, and delicious, our Mild Kota combines crispy bacon, melted cheese, and slap chips, all served in a rectangular, easy-to-eat sandwich style.
                
                Presidential Buffet Kota: Our crown jewel, the all-you-can-eat experience! Stuffed with ribs, two types of cheese, your choice of sauce, chips, Russian, Viennas, and spicy atchar—plus a side of ribs, boerewors, and steak. It’s the ultimate Kota for those ready to go all out!</p>

            <p>At Tebatso’s Kota, we believe food should be bold, comforting, and shared with good company. Our mission is to bring the unique taste of Hammanskraal to locals and visitors alike, celebrating the spirit of South Africa’s townships. Every kota we make honors our roots and represents the joy, laughter, and resilience of our community.</p>

            <p>When you come to Tebatso’s Kota, you’re not just stopping for a meal—you’re joining a movement of flavor, family, and local pride. We’re committed to serving quality ingredients, generous portions, and a genuine Hammanskraal experience. With us, you’ll taste the love and tradition in every bite.

                So come on by, bring your friends, and experience Tebatso’s Kota for yourself. We can’t wait to serve you the best kota in Pretoria Hammanskraal and welcome you to the Tebatso’s family!</p>
